# TYPO3 Extension "taskcenter"

The Task Center adds a module to the user drop down in the toolbar.
It is the framework for a host of other extensions, eg. "sys_action".

The functionality was part of the TYPO3 Core until TYPO3 v10.0, and moved into its
own extension, receiving its own public repository.

## Installation
The latest version can be installed via TER (http://typo3.org) or via composer
by adding ''composer require friendsoftypo3/taskcenter'' in a TYPO3 v10.0+ installation.

## Current state
The extension has been part of TYPO3 Core for a very long time but never
received much love. It may become more healthy if maintained as third party
extension and has been extracted for this reason.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit any pull request, or add documentation, tests, as you please.
We will publish a new version every once in a while, depending on the amount of changes
and pull requests submitted.

### License
The extension is published under GPL v2+, all included third-party libraries are
published under their respective licenses.

### Authors
Many contributors have been working on this area while this functionality was part of
the TYPO3 Core. This package is now maintained by a loose group of TYPO3 enthusiasts inside
the TYPO3 Community. Feel free to contact Benni Mack (benni.mack@typo3.org) for any questions
regarding "taskcenter".
