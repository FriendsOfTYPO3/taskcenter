The Task Center adds a module to the user's drop-down menu in the toolbar. It
provides the framework into which other extensions hook, for example, the
`sys_action <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sys_action/>`__ extension.

The functionality was part of the TYPO3 Core until TYPO3 v10.0, and moved into
its own extension, receiving its own public repository.
